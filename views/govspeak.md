$!If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your pension pot or how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.$!

##Check value of your pension pot

You can:

- phone your pension provider (the pension scheme you paid into)
- look at your pension statement - your provider should have sent you these once a year
- look at your ‘wake-up pack’ - this is the pack you got from your pension provider between 6 and 4 months before your agreed retirement age (usually between 55 and 65)

If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and haven’t got a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.

You might have paid into more than one pension pot during your working life. To find out the value of your entire pension pot you need to contact each provider.

^You need this information if you want to [talk to an expert](LINK TO BOOKING) and get guidance on what to do with your pension pot.^
